# [EDOPro/Ygopro](https://discord.gg/ygopro-percy) HD Pics Downloader v2.2.2

This program automates the process of:
- Access [YGO Cards Database](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/); 
- Choose a card;
- Scroll down to 'Download JPG image' option;
- Download it into the game's pics folder.

The method is simple, a python script gets a list of cards ids in a ydk file and use link manipulation to download card per card directly into the pics folder.
